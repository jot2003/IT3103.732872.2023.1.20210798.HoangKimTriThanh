Question:
•	After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 
•	After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Aswer:
In Java, parameters are passed by value, meaning the values of the arguments are passed to the parameters of a method. However, when it comes to objects, the value passed is a reference to the object, not the actual object itself. Therefore, when swapping o1 and o2 in the swap() method, the external state remains unchanged.

In contrast, in the changeTitle() method, the title is genuinely modified by using setTitle() so the title is effectively changed.
